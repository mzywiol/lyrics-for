Under the Radar


Nobody saw our sails on the horizon
Nobody heard propellers in the dawn
Nobody smelt our coal fires were burning
Nobody knew--under the radar we crept on.

Here we come, on the run, our coal fires are burning
Here we come, fife and drum, propellers in the dawn
Here we come, on the run, our coal fires are burning
Here we come, fife and drum, under the radar we crept on!

Nobody saw our broadsides at their window
Nobody heard our trapdoors swinging wide
Nobody saw our cannons taking aim
Nobody heard my whispered "Fire, blow their sides."

Here we come, on the run, our coal fires are burning
Here we come, fife and drum, propellers in the dawn
Here we come, on the run, our coal fires are burning
Here we come, fife and drum, under the radar we crept on!

Somebody heard our cannon fire ringing
Somebody saw the windows shattering
Somebody saw the hooks and tethers flying
Somebody saw my crew with swords drawn coming in!

Here we come, on the run, our coal fires are burning
Here we come, fife and drum, propellers in the dawn
Here we come, on the run, our coal fires are burning
Here we come, fife and drum, under the radar we crept on!

Building Steam


I, I've suffered long enough in this ghost town
I saw the walls, called their bluff and took them down

When I think of all the time I've wasted
All the bitter pills I've tasted
I have to hang my head and frown
I, I've suffered long enough in this ghost town

Soon came a day under skies that were gray
When I knew I couldn't stay in this ghost town full of
Clones and clowns and carbon copy towns, with
Kine and swine and nothing that was mine,
And this town's decline with my hatred intertwined,
So I gather all I find and I bolt it to me,
Fueled my fires and I grabbed my pliers, and I'm lit!

I made my own machine
Yes, we're building steam
I hate the same routine

I made my own machine
Yes, we're building steam
I hate the same routine

I, I never looked back--I want to never return
If I could find a fuse, those bridges would burn

But I keep this horse at a run
Keep my hand to my gun
My path the vampires have learned
So I, I can never look back; I can never return

Soon came a day under skies that were gray
When I knew I couldn't stay in this ghost town full of
Clones and clowns and carbon copy towns, with
Kine and swine and nothing that was mine,
And this town's decline with my hatred intertwined,
So I gather all I find and I bolt it to me,
Fueled my fires and I grabbed my pliers, and I'm lit!

I made my own machine
Yes, we're building steam
I hate the same routine

Until The Day You Die


I've chased this dream since I was five
And I have barely stayed alive
While folks have fallen off this ship
Well, I have never lost my grip

So hate me
You might as well hate me
And go on, berate me
Until the day you die

I'm going straight through
I'm not gonna hate you
But I won't wait for you
Until the day I die

Some folks will tell me I'm all wrong
He's all wrong
But I won't listen, well, not for long
No, not for long
My whole life I've planned this trip
He's planned this trip
And to my plan I'm gonna stick
He's gonna stick

So hate me
You might as well hate me
And go on, berate me
Until the day you die

But I'm going straight through
I'm not going to hate you
But I won't wait for you
Until the day I die

"Doctor Weird's mystery will be continued shortly. Say, by the way, doctor, is mystery your sole pleasure?"
"Young man, what could be more pleasant than mystery?"
"Well, music. I mean the kind of music men hum or whistle when they feel on top of the world!"

So hate me
You might as well hate me
And go on, berate me
Until the day you die

But I'm going straight through
I'm not gonna hate you
But I won't wait for you
Until the day I die

Am I the villain, are things as they seem?

Wanderlust


This world is filled with islands
Little specks of sand
Mountain peaks in a cloudy sky

Each one's a different world
And so my sails unfurled
And I will raise my sails high

When I am feeling stagnant
My lungs are filled with mud
I dream of Beijing and Molokai

When I am feeling down
Get my feet off the ground
And throw my head back to the sky

And fly!
Alive!

This world is filled with rust
I could drown in this dust
I need to see the Bhutan sky

I hear my soul groan
I feel my muscles moan
If I can't wander I will die

I could wander alone
Or take my whole damn home
I could give a monkey's eye

As long as the road's clear
A song is in my ear
And I will kiss this place goodbye

And fly!

This world is filled with islands
Little specks of sand
Mountain peaks in a cloudy sky

Each one's a different world
And so my sails unfurled
And I will raise my sails high

When I am feeling stagnant
My lungs are filled with mud
I dream of Beijing and Molokai

When I am feeling down
Get my feet off the ground
And throw my head back to the sky

And fly!
Alive!

Throw Them Overboard


If you map out my psychology
It will look like archaeology
I've got no love for this society
I prefer total free autonomy!

Take your newfangled this, and your newfangled that,
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
Your newfangled this, and your newfangled that,
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!

We've made an art of this horology
To the point of a new theology
I say to hell with modern technology
And we embrace analog mythology!

Take your newfangled this, and your newfangled that,
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
Your newfangled this, and your newfangled that,
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!

This society's technology
Is an aesthetic anthropophagy
To survive this cultural urology
You have to study alcohology—

Or take your newfangled this, and your newfangled that,
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!
Your newfangled this, and your newfangled that,
And you can line them up and throw them overboard!

The Derelict


Fifteen men on the Dead Man's chest

Drink and the Devil had done for the rest

The mate was fixed with the bo'sun's pike
And the bo'sun brained with a marlin-spike,
Cookie's throat was marked belike
It had been gripped by fingers ten,
And there they lay, all good dead men,
Like break o' day in a boozin' den
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men of the whole ship's list

Dead and bedamned and the rest gone whist

The skipper lay with his nob in gore
Where the scullion's axe his cheek had shore,
And the scullion he'd been stabbed times four
And there they lay, and the soggy skies
Dripped all day long up staring eyes
By murk sunset and by foul sunrise--
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men of 'em stiff and stark

Ten of the crew with a murder mark

'Twas a cutlass swipe or an ounce of lead,
Or a yawning hole in a battered head,
And the scupper's a-glut with a rotting red
And there they lay, aye, damn me eyes,
Their lookouts clapped on Paradise,
And their souls gone just contrariwise--
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men of 'em good and true

Every man-jack could 'a sailed with Old Pew

There was chest on chest full of Spanish gold,
With a ton of plate in the middle hold,
The cabins a riot of loot untold--
And there they lay that took the plum,
With sightless glare and lips struck dumb,
While we shared all by the rule of thumb--
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

More was seen through a stern light screen

Charting, no doubt, where a woman had been

A flimsy shift on a bunkered cot
With a thin dirk slot through the bosom spot
And the lace stiff dry with a purplish blot--
Oh, was she a wench, some shuddering maid
That dared the knife and took the blade
By God, she was tough for a plucky jade--
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

Fifteen men on the Dead Man's chest,
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!
Drink and the Devil had done for the rest,
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

Wrapped them all in the mainsail tight,
Twice ten turns of a hawser's bight
And we heaved them over and out of sight
With a yo-heave-ho and a fare-ye-well,
A sudden plunge in a sullen swell
Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell--
Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum!

Victoria


Victoria, come back to me
I should have never believed
You've been gone so long
Why did I let you leave?

Victoria, come back to me
I should have never believed
You've been gone so long
Why did I let you leave?

Was it simply my self-doubt
That made me give you away?
I thought I couldn't take care of you
Now I'll never see the day

Victoria, come back to me
I should have never believed
You've been gone so long
Why did I let you leave?

Victoria, come back to me
I should have never believed
You've been gone so long
Why did I let you leave?

Our family fell upon hard times
So many mouths to feed
Thought you could have a better life
How could I have seen their greed?

Victoria, come back to me
I should have never believed
You've been gone so long
Why did I let you leave?

Victoria, come back to me
I should have never believed
You've been gone so long
You've been gone so long
You've been gone so long
Why did I let you leave?

Ather Shanty


My arms aching, back's breaking, legs aching, neck
And this whole ruddy ship is a huge creaking wreck.
We've flown ten thousand miles with this thorn in our sides
Though the wind's steady, strong with no clouds in the skies.

The ropes creaking, ship's leaking, sails are on fire,
And this whole bloody ship could go up like a pyre.
Crew's got smiles on their faces, but we've seen this before
No telling just now what we have in store.

The back-stabbing, loot-nabbing plans behind doors
Running low on the rum and depleting our stores
Can't tell who's on our side and who's ready to flip
When we hit the next port the whole crew could jump ship.

With the moods flaring, crew's glaring, cut-throats the lot
With a paranoid captain always smelling a plot
We've worked hard on this journey, but there's no land in sight
And before it's all ended there could be a fight.

My arms aching, back's breaking, legs aching, neck
And this whole ruddy ship is a huge creaking wreck.
We've flown ten thousand miles with this thorn in our sides
Though the wind's steady strong with no clouds in the skies.

The ropes creaking, ship's leaking, sails are on fire,
And this whole bloody ship could go up like a pyre.
Crew's got smiles on their faces, but we've seen this before
No telling just now what we have in store.

The Clock Yard


There was a young boy in a clock yard
Building himself from the pieces he found
Screwing on what's been left on the ground
Hoping to finish enough one day to leave

The years flew by and some gears fell off
Fears and rust and tears he doffed
And bravely searched, while parts he scoffed, but soon he found--

There was a young man in a clock yard
Building himself from the pieces he found
Screwing on what's been left on the ground
Hoping to finish enough one day to leave

The years flew by and some gears fell off
Fears and rust and tears he doffed
And bravely searched, while parts he scoffed, but soon he found--

There was a grown man in a clock yard
Building himself from the pieces he found
Screwing on what's been left on the ground
Hoping to finish enough one day to lead

He thought to himself, "If I wait too long
To find the pieces I need, then my chance might be gone
What I need might be outside the gate
But I will never know, if I continue to wait."

And then he had a dream:

An old man cried in a clock yard,
Giving up on the scrap that he found on the ground,
"I can't build myself from this scrap all around!"

The man woke up and said, "I must leave.
I must leave.
I must leave.
I must leave."

Too Far To Turn Back 


We've come too far to turn back
It's way too dark to unpack
We'd stop right here but we're slipping
This ground is loose, we're not gripping

We're way in over our heads, it seems
And this place is coming apart at the seams
We can't stop or control our direction
The further we go, the less protection

Suddenly the beast takes notice
Unexpectedly we've earned his focus
We got here by a naive assumption
Our confidence was a false presumption

We're way in over our heads, it seems
And this place is coming apart at the seams
We can't stop or control our direction
The further we go, the less protection

We've come too far to turn back
It's way too dark to unpack
We'd stop right here but we're slipping
This ground is loose, we're not gripping

We're way in over our heads, it seems
And this place is coming apart at the seams
We can't stop or control our direction
The further we go, the less protection

We've come too far
We've come too far
It's way too dark
It's way too dark
We've come too far
We've come too far
T,t,t,turn back turn back turn back turn back
Turn back turn back turn back turn back...
