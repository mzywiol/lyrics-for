If I were the wind

If I were the wind and you were the rain
That blows from east to west that melts away this pain.
If I were the sea and you were the sky
I could wash away those tears
And our hearts again would fly.

And the pirates and the thieves might bring you to your knees
But they'll never board your ship.
You may have to sail through troubled seas
But the stars will always lead you
To the sun on the horizon
And you will feel life again
As the storm shows mercy on your sails.

People my people, captain my captain.
Sail this empty vessel away from here to calmer shores.
People my people, captain my captain.
Sail this empty vessel away from here to calmer shores. 

And the pirates and the buccaneers
Who fought you through the years
Now kneel and bow to you
They see a strength in you
And you will be their king.
And the rest of the world will see.
And want to follow right behind you.
Because you fought them off with that weapon
The sword of mercy and truth.

It's all so fearless now.
Now the dust has settled down.
It's time to say goodbye
To the lives I touched and left behind.
But through this melody and rhyme
I'll find some comfort here.

On waters new we set sail.
Our eyes set on a new world.
It's time to wave goodbye.
Wiped from your memory.
But so fair of face and a heart of gold.
My son my son.

The Dance Of The Seven Veils

i) Faithless

An old man came here telling tales
Of days gone by and seven veils.
A sanctuary for all the pedlars of the lie.
But one by one the veils fall
Through the subtlety of time recall.
The words they longed to kill
Would not be silent be still.

You were faithless in a twist of fate.
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate
It's just my view but you know what I say is true.

It was the month of the strawberry moon
The smell of apples and summer's bloom.
Ten thousand horses could not drag you centre stage.
To weary sailors the sirens sing
You hiding in the stage's wings.
Forever clawing at your chains and your white feathers.

You were faithless in a twist of fate.
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate.
And to the stars our words will rise
Forever bound and sealed.

You were faithless in a twist of fate.
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate.
Each act and motion locked away
Will be known in the end.

You were faithless in a twist of fate.
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate.

At last the veils have fallen down.
They squirm like vipers on the ground.
In time the power of passion's lust
Slip through your fingers and turns to dust.

Naked now you too were deceived.
And now you must stare into the eyes of the Gorgon.

Here within the time we spent upon this mortal coil
Not knowing what it all meant.
Our lives of pain and toil
Are those still standing tall beyond the china wall.



ii) All Over Now

From the first drop of blood spilt
To the last breath of man.
Betrayal by the hand that leads the innocent hand.
A friend they thought was a friend to fight.
From William Wallace to Jesus Christ.

It hurts when you say.
You never knew me anyway.
But it's all over now.
It's so hard when you say.
You never knew me anyway.
But it's all over now.

You drank from the poison cup
Not knowing it was a trap.
It's strange but so true
The ones who love you will run you through
With swords and knives then run for their lives.
Like the rose as petals fall
As the dance of the veils calls.
But it's all over now
But it's all over now

Like a gypsy it seeks
To serenade you while you sleep.
But is cutting out your heart
Leaving scars that runs so deep.
Like a moth to a flame
That just keeps burning through your life.
But the lure of those sweet
Words of love keep calling.

It hurts when you say.
I never knew you anyway.
But it's all over now.
And it hurts when you say.
I never knew you anyway.
But it's all over now.
And it hurts when you say.
I never loved you anyway.
But it's all over now.
And it hurts when you say.
I never knew you anyway.
But it's all over now.

We set sail on waters new.
Our eyes set on a new world.
It's time to wave goodbye
To the lives I touched and left behind.
But through this melody and rhyme
I'll find some comfort here.

Not Of This World

i) Not Of This World

Looking for god - looking for life.
Looking for all the right words and answers.
Looking for something not of this world.

Here within the time we spent upon this mortal coil.
Not knowing what it meant.
Beyond the china wall.
Are those still standing tall now fit to fall.
I need to save me from myself

Looking for hope - looking for home.
Looking away from all the despair.
Looking for something that just isn't there.

Here within the time we spent upon this mortal coil.
Not knowing what it meant.
Beyond the china wall.
Are those still standing tall.
Beyond our wildest dreams and human means.
And me I must save me from myself.
And be far away from me.
And my soul must be free.
I'm flesh and blood I'm a human being.
I'm flesh and blood I'm a human being.

Here within this human shell
Lies a heart that beats - A soul that weeps.
The landscape of my life has changed.
My soul will never be the same.
So what love can I now give?
That will not be betrayed.
It was never meant to be to one.
But those who can hear these words and stayed...
"Ridi Pagliacci"



ii) Give It To Me

One man fills his pockets with gold
From the rising cost of dying.
Consumed by consumerism
Telephone lines keep lying.

Give it to me
[getting bigger better quicker]

Oh oh oh oh give it to me
[getting faster for the brave new world]

Just give it to me
[bigger better quicker]

Oh oh oh oh give it to me
[getting faster for the brave new...]

Eating money wanting more.
Give it to the rich and rob from the poor.
One day man will eat the world.
Fill his pockets and sell his soul.

Give it to me
[getting bigger better quicker]

Oh oh oh oh give it to me
[getting faster for the brave new world]

Just give it to me
[bigger better quicker]

Oh oh oh oh give it to me
[getting faster for the brave new...]

Cos they're flesh and blood.
They're just human beings.
They're flesh and blood.
They're just human beings.

You should have buried me at childbirth.
You should have never let me free.
Now I won't go away from here.
You cannot put back the fruit on the tree.



iii) Green Eyed Angel

All those friends I've known and lost they tell me it'll be alright.
Not with empty words or hearts they tell me I will be alright.
And with her wings she shelters me and tells me it'll be alright.

Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows.

Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to leave me.

I sense those friends I know but can't see, they tell me it'll be alright.
When they lay their hands on me I feel them near and I will be alright.
And though my heart still has this dark place.
Day by day it'll feel more light.

Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows.

Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one.

Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows.

Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows.
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven.
That summer day of '94 was such a happy day

When they lay their hands down on me and I feel them near I know it'll be alright.
Hearts so young against a heart of stone not to love that child.
And although my heart still has this dark place
Day by day I know it'll feel more light.
Hearts so young against a heart of stone.

A Man Of Nomadic Traits

I am a man of nomadic traits.
A bedouin of wandering fate.
To cross the deserts to the sea
Where my soul becomes the sea and me.
At times a bird at times a child
Sometimes animal sometimes wild.
Ruled by numbers by figures and by facts
To free the self made prison
From the darkness and the rats.
At times a bird at times a child
Sometimes animal sometimes wild

I am a man of nomadic traits
And Bedouin sisters are saving me.
You reap what you sow
And in time don't you know.
When wisdom comes to call
If there's nobody listening at all.

And so this story has no end.
Man's search for true enlightenment.
Where others see reality
Is a mirage that I clearly see.
I sometimes wonder who's right and who's wrong
In this crazy world I don't belong.

I am a man of nomadic traits
And Bedouin sisters are saving me.
You reap what you sow
And in time don't you know.
When wisdom comes to call
If there's nobody listening at all.

I am a man of nomadic traits
And wandering fate through people's lives.
Be strong and wise
Look with kind and gentle eyes.

The World's End

i) The Lost Children

We started out life so innocent but got lost somewhere on the way.
Learnt little from the wars we've raged that keep coming back round again.

As I look backwards my mind becomes hazy
And all that I find is the world has got crazier.
Time after time as the blind lead the blind
That hopelessly leads us in circles again.

We came here free as children and we'll leave here just the same.
With nothing to show for our best intentions
But a path of destruction and blame.

And on up that hill we traveled with no cause to care for others.
So where are all the lost children?
They're you and me and you're still my brothers.

As I look backwards my mind becomes hazy
And all that I find is the world has got crazier.
Time after time as the blind lead the blind
That hopelessly leads us in circles again.

There is faith there is truth there is love but the greatest of these is love.

These are the shores on which we played so long ago.
The crystal wave no longer falls.

Men of steel who endured the most The Father The Son and The Holy Ghost.
The butterflies of war flying so high sick as a pig on American pie.

The seasons change the moon turns red.
Don't surrender your courage to the voices in your head.
You'd give all you have now to put right all the wrongs.
So where are all the lost children? They're coming home to stay this time.

These are the shores on which we once played
Were the flowers and the green trees just a dream we made?
Respect my friend was a lesson you never learned.

So where are all the lost children? They're coming home to stay this time.



ii) And Finally...

Heading for hope - heading for home
Heading for roads that don't lead me back here

Looking at you - Looking at me
Looking at days and nights with no fear
Looking for something not of this world

Here within the time we spent upon this mortal coil
Not knowing what it all meant our lives of pain and toil
Are those still standing tall beyond the china wall

And those who life now have endured
Are called unto the shore
And my soul will be free
I'll fly free now as a bird
Our voices to be heard

They're flesh and blood they were human beings
They're flesh and blood they were human beings

Here within the time we spent
Upon this mortal coil
Not knowing what it all meant
Our lives of pain and toil
Are those still standing tall
Beyond the china wall
And me and my soul will be free
The greed of man will be
So far away from me
I'll fly free now as a bird
Our voices to be heard

They're flesh and blood they were human beings
They're flesh and blood they were human beings

Paintbox (acoustic version)

Painting pictures of a thousand different paths.
We sketch an outline of a love that hopes to last.
Casting a wand over imaginary hopes
And close our eyes so we don't feel the ebb and flow.

And paintbox you are my only hope
Of covering the faded past and starting out once more.
With a fortune in new colours new hopes to inspire.
I paint the path I want to take and paint a life of fire.

Making out our lives full of different plans.
Excitedly we hold the key to change our hearts and hands.
We climb the hill to see if green fields lie beyond.
Only to realise they've faded now and gone.

And paintbox you are my only hope
Of covering the faded past and starting out once more.
With a fortune in new colours new hopes to inspire.
I paint the path I want to take and paint a life of fire.

Painting pictures of a thousand different paths.
We sketch an outline of a love that hopes to last.
Casting a wand over imaginary hopes
And close our eyes so we don't feel the ebb and flow.

And paintbox you are my only hope
Of covering the faded past and starting out once more.
With a fortune in new colours new hopes to inspire.
I paint the path I want to take and paint a life of fire.

King Of The Castle (acoustic version)

Crossing the wastelands to carry me home.
Holding the last breath of faith to the end.
Rising from ashes my task is now done.
I took the vows.
My only bows.

Looking for somewhere that's home to me now.
The king of the castle and his sacred cow.
I've travelled the world and by chance this is how
The lies became true
Between me and you.
Free spirit I've travelled so follow me now.

Held by the raging and powerful sea
Never threw up my hands to accept the defeat.
Long nights of questions, no answers to hold.
A heart of gold.
My kindred soul.

Looking for somewhere that's home to me now.
The king of the castle and his sacred cow.
I've travelled the world and by chance this is how
The lies became true
Between me and you.
Free spirit I've travelled so follow me now.
