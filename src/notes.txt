Ideas on how to find where song lyrics start:

* Go blob by blob,
** check first line in blob if it contains song title
*** maybe with some number at the beginning. if this number equals tracknumber, that's it!
*** maybe with time signature at the end. if it's there, that's it!
** if it's first song on the album and we find it i tracklist?
*** figure out the song title line format (e.g. ##. TITLE) and check if next line has the same format
*** or if next line contains the title of the next song

Ideas on how to find where song lyrics end:
* Once the lyrics header (i.e. song title) is found, go back and check the format of song separator: what are the parts
up to previous TEXT blob? look for a similar sequence of parts below
** what if the song separator is just one empty line?
** check the next line after song sparator if it conforms to the song header format and contains next song title.


one way or another, the next song title is needed.


ASSUMPTIONS:
* songs are in the same order in txt files as on albums and in files
* files have numbers in filenames
* numbers in filenames occur before song title
* separators are only between songs, maybe underline the title, but not within -> is this true?

NOT GUARANTED:
* song numbers in file don't have to be digits only
* song tracknumbers can gave gaps
* song numbers in filenames don't have to be the same as in lyrics files and tracknumber tags
* not all songs are separated by separator, even within one album (see Pendragon - Not of This World)
* not all songs have lyrics in files (some are missing, some are instrumental)
* not all songs have total tracks tag
* not all multidisc album songs have disc number and total disc number
