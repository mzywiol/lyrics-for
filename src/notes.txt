Find song lyrics in file:

approach: look for song title and then look for end of lyrics

1. look for line with song title
    use difflib
2. check if it's not in tracklist
    does the file start with a tracklist?
    line before: call: looks_like_song_title
    line after: call: looks_like_song_title
3. check if it looks like title
    call: looks_like_song_lyrics_headline
        record structure
4. consume line by line until another separator or line that looks like song lyrics headline with similar structure



function: looks_like_song_title
    starts with a number?
    starts with a different bullet? *, @, ii) etc.
    ends with song length

function: looks_like_song_lyrics_headline
    call: looks_like_song_title
    lines before: are blank?
    lines before: is there a separator?
    lines after: are blank?
    lines after: is there a separator?










approach: analyze file, look for structure: separators, song lyric headlines format, look for promising lines and

record separators (their format, symbols used)
    are they before headline? SEPARATOR or UNDERLINE or both
        if there are pairs very close to each other, then both
record lines starting with numbers
    analyze: are they incremental?
    is there more than one incremental set? -> may be multiple disc, may be tracklist at the beginning
        divide into incremental sets
        secord separator after number (. or ) or anything else)
        is there tracklength at the end?
            record for this set
        are the numbered lines close to each other? -> indicates tracklist
        are there separators before or after each numbered line? -> indicates lyrics; record
    ignore tracklists
if SEPARATORS and NUMBERED LINES:
    find numbered line with song title just before or after a SEPARATOR -> this is where LYRIC BEGIN
    //ignore UNDERLINE
    find another separator -> this is where LYRIC ENDS
if NUMBERED LINES only:
    find numbered line with song title -> this is where LYRIC BEGIN
    find next numbered line -> this is where LYRIC ENDS
if SEPARATOR only:
    check lines just before and just after the SEPARATORS for their similarity to the title
    if just before, SEPARATOR is UNDERLINE -> this is where LYRIC BEGIN
    find another separator -> this is where LYRIC ENDS
if neither:
    find lines containing title
    lines ending with song length are good candidates for headline -> this is where LYRIC BEGIN
        otherwise, evaluate by similarity
        the first most similar will be where LYRIC BEGIN
    consume lines until first GAP longer than previous GAPS. -> this is where LYRIC ENDS

Ideas on how to find where song lyrics start:

* Go blob by blob,
** check first line in blob if it contains song title
*** maybe with some number at the beginning. if this number equals tracknumber, that's it!
*** maybe with time signature at the end. if it's there, that's it!
** if it's first song on the album and we find it i tracklist?
*** figure out the song title line format (e.g. ##. TITLE) and check if next line has the same format
*** or if next line contains the title of the next song

Ideas on how to find where song lyrics end:
* Once the lyrics header (i.e. song title) is found, go back and check the format of song separator: what are the parts
up to previous TEXT blob? look for a similar sequence of parts below
** what if the song separator is just one empty line?
** check the next line after song sparator if it conforms to the song header format and contains next song title.


one way or another, the next song title is needed.


ASSUMPTIONS:
* songs are in the same order in txt files as on albums and in files
* files have numbers in filenames
* numbers in filenames occur before song title
* separators are only between songs, maybe underline the title, but not within -> is this true?

NOT GUARANTED:
* song numbers in file don't have to be digits only
* song tracknumbers can gave gaps
* song numbers in filenames don't have to be the same as in lyrics files and tracknumber tags
* not all songs are separated by separator, even within one album (see Pendragon - Not of This World)
* not all songs have lyrics in files (some are missing, some are instrumental)
* not all songs have total tracks tag
* not all multidisc album songs have disc number and total disc number
