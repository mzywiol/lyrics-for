1. Don't Say A Word (Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain) 03:38
	
	
Fire on the ocean
Reprisal in motion
From the quiet awake

The sins of the father
Are hitting me harder
Every strike I take

The silence is deafening...
Don't say a word

The venom inside us
Strives to deny us
Just a moment's peace

From ocean to land we
Are learning to stand on
Our own two feet

Not to be heard
Don't say a word
Restrain...
Cut out the phrase
Only a haze
Remains...

The silence is deafening...
Don't say a word

These syllables slither
Like snakes in the sand...
These words they will wither
The world in your hands

You are the voice in the song yeah
It's yours when you sing along...

The silence is deafening...
Don't say a word

You are the voice in the song, yeah
It's yours when you sing along...

2. London Town (Assassin's Creed: Syndicate) 03:58
	
	
Slaves in seas of soot we drown
Come on down to London town
The cogs they creak and the pistons pound
Come on down to London town

Power cloaked in progress
Smoke in Eden's eyes
A million choking chimneys burn and
Blacken out the sky

Grab your mates and join us
Where the rats rejoice
The brazen brass of the working class
Are here to find their voice

Revolution holds us bound
Come on down to London town
Break your back for class and crown
Come on down to London town

Steam train running on a reckless rail
Speeding right into the rising gale
Shovel harder cos we're on your tail
London's bloody cry

Crippled to deliver
The spoils of industry
Crimson are the rivers
Bleed our grief into the sea

Slaves in seas of soot we drown
Come on down to London town
The cogs they creak and the pistons pound
Come on down to London town


Steam train running on a reckless rail
Speeding right into the rising gale
Shovel harder cos we're on your tail
London's bloody cry

Cry revolution, broken dreams
Cruel revolution smoke and steam

3. Lady Of Worlds (The Witcher III: Wild Hunt - Ciri) 04:52
	
	
I'm here again
No place and everywhere
Black bark and smouldering air
My influence

Another turn
Another peace to shun
Gauntlet of frost to run
No difference

Back and forth on the pendulum
Swinging hard towards the outside
Smash the walls of the clocks and run
Overcoming the confines

Time and space on the frailest veil
Frozen cold in the static
Bloody blades under hatred's sails
Tearing out through the fabric

The shimmer of white skies
I spin to & fro
A flicker of wild eyes
Gifts I can't control
The shimmer of white skies
The legacy leashed in my cries
Shall reign over bitter white skies

I pay the debt
Muse to another's song
Heir to another's wrongs
Unwanted crown
Dance on the wind
Through space and time I swirl
The lady of the worlds
Don't hold me down

Back and forth on the pendulum
Swinging hard towards the outside
Smash the walls of the clocks and run
Overcoming the confines

Wake the wolf with a distant roar
Strands of ash separated
To entwine on a misty shore
Troubled lives ever fated

The shimmer of white skies
I spin to & fro
A flicker of wild eyes
Gifts I can't control
The shimmer of white skies
The legacy leashed in my cries
Shall reign over bitter white skies

Weave these strands of ash
Together
Warm our hands on the embers of time

The shimmer of white skies
She spins to & fro
A flicker of wild eyes
She's losing control
The shimmer of white skies
I'm haunted at night by her cries
Yeah I'm frozen cold....

The shimmer of white skies
I spin to & fro
A flicker of wild eyes
Gifts I can't control
The shimmer of white skies
The worth I no longer defy
Shall reign over bitter white skies

I can hear the drums in the distance...
Discord on the air
I can hear the drums in the distance...

WITNESS!!!!

Nitro
Burnin' in the brain ya got a face of glowin' chrome
Mindfucked
Speedin to the rhythm of the thunder in your dome
Road rage
Heavy metal engines rumble, thunder, roar
Red riff
Strikin up a chord to the drums of bloody war

Off the course!!

I am the fury and the force
I am the river and the source
Behold the cerberus!!!
Guns and gas and gods!!

Seeds of redemption we sow
On softer soil may they grow

Fury under the hood
The charge of motherhood
I will never be slowed, will not be caged
Fury under the hood
The charge of motherhood
I will redden the road, release the rage!!

5. Stay By My Side (Journey) 03:55
		
	
Stay By My Side

Distant silhouettes
Empty horizons
Sing a still duet
Affections tighten

Kindred ribbons
Spring us from our tethers
Rivers drifting
Vivid and together

Stay by my side
Soft songs in harmony
Stay by my side
Companions kind now
You and me

Surf the golden waves
On silken highways
Painting flowing braids
In sunken byways

Spacious flow embolden
Ever climbing
Gracious moments hold us
Intertwining

Stay by my side
Soft songs in harmony
Stay by my side
Companions kind now
You and me

6. Going Nuclear (Fallout 4) 01:59
	
	
Wake up to the jive of the bell
No sweat now I'm feelin' swell
Well gee, golly it's a beautiful day!
Gonna burn my troubles away

I'm goin' nuclear
Light up the town!
The walls that hold me
Are melting down
I'm rising up like
A mushroom cloud
I'm going nuclear
Lightin' up this town!

Fire up now I'm havin' a blast
Cool kicks baby it's a gas!
The airwaves are a galaxy
All the stars are singin' to me

I'm goin' nuclear
Light up the town
The walls that hold me
Are melting down
The streets and sidewalks
Are my playground
I'm going nuclear
Lightin' up this town!

Hit the tubs, Jack!

Gee golly now!

I'm goin' nuclear
Light up the town
The walls that hold me
Are melting down
I'm rising up like
A mushroom cloud
I'm going nuclear
Lightin' up this town!

7. Friends (Guardians of the Galaxy - Movie) 03:48
	
	
Scanning the stars at night
An infinity in inches contained
Feelin like nobody knows you
Sometimes you wanna shout out your name

Sisters scorned
Brothers worn
Lonely pain is harder to mend
Flora tall
Fauna small
Get you on your feet again

So lean a little on your friends
They will carry you
Shelter from the stormy nights
Lean a little on your friends
They will guide you through
You know you're gonna be alright

Lookin at all we've lost
All the pain that livin' hard can bring
When we are together yeah
We can take on anyone anything

Sisters scorned
Brothers worn
Lonely pain is harder to mend
Flora tall
Fauna small
Get you on your feet again

So lean a little on your friends
They will carry you
Shelter from the stormy nights
Lean a little on your friends
They will guide you through
You know you're gonna be alright

And when you're bitter and tired
And your voices are mute
We will take the time to understand
You hang around for a while now
Lay down your roots
It's time to grab a helping hand

And when you're punching for vengeance
Literally
Cause you can't find a metaphor
Or if you're weary and wasted
Or feel like a freak
We'll always pick you up off the floor

So lean a little on your friends
They will carry you
Shelter from the stormy nights
Lean a little on your friends
They will guide you through
You know you're gonna be alright

8. I Am The Night (Batman - Arkham Knight) 03:38
	

A curtain call
The wings are waiting for the night to fall
Spread over the stage
Can't keep me out
I've always pummeled through the doors of doubt
Power through the plagues

Wit for pace
This riddle's just a race
Old self pities
Cleanse this city's waste

I am the night
A tyrant of the shade
I am the spite
I am the pain repaid
I am the night
A fear that lies in shadows cannot fade
Crush the light
I am the night

Listening
The ripple of a heartbeat quickening
Fear behind the eyes
Uneasy prey
The broken bones litter the alleyways
Terror from the skies

Check my head
I guess the joke's on me
I'm not laughing
At the irony

I am the night
A tyrant of the shade
I am the spite
I am the pain repaid
I am the night
A fear that lies in shadows cannot fade
Crush the light
I am the night

The chill
Of the shadow that lurks inside this mind
It builds
Breathe the fear out and face it one last time

I am the night
A tyrant of the shade
I am the spite
I am the pain repaid
I am the night
A fear that lies in shadows cannot fade
Crush the light
I am the night

And now the joke is on me...
I am the night

9. Evacuate 03:49
	

Good friends will part sometimes
That's just the way it goes
Don't waste your life banging on
Doors that have been closed

Sometimes the ones you trust the most
Will let you down
Life doesn't hold back
When it's kicking you around

You've lived a little, loved a little
Tasted bitter heartache
You've got to just forget the ones who hurt you
For your own sake

If they can't see it your way
Walk through that open doorway
Before your sadness turns to hate...

Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh!
Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh!
Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh!
Don't let it get you down!

The world is such a scary place
When you're alone
You're on an empty stage
You got no microphone

But don't you hide behind the curtains
In the wings
Step out into the lights and
Let 'em hear you sing

You've laughed a little, cried a little
Now you know the dangers
You've seen so many faces once familiar
Turn to strangers

If they can't see it your way
Walk through that open doorway
Before your sadness turns to hate...

Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh!
Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh!
Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh!
Don't let it get you down!

Please don't let it shut you out
There is always more...

If they can't see it your way
Walk through that open doorway
Before your sadness turns to hate...

(Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh)
Good friends will part sometimes now
(Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh)
Good friends will part sometimes now
(Evacuate o-o-oh o-oh)
Before your sadness turns to hate...

Evacuate!

10. My Shooting Star (Firefly/Serenity - Movie) 04:16
		
	
Just another no-one
Keep the family sound
Like a comet we run
By her gravity bound

In the big black empty sea
She is always there with me
Keeps me sheltered, keeps me free
She is always there with me

Through the silent we go
Yeah she's the shiniest sight
Such a beautiful glow
Little light in the night

In the big black empty sea
She is always there with me
Keeps me sheltered, keeps me free
She is always there with me

Oh don't dry the rain my shooting star
Steer me when I aim to misbehave
Oh don't dry the rain my shooting star
Wash away the leaves upon our graves

Wash it away

Oh she's my shooting star
Carried me so far
Yeah the she's the shiniest sight
My little light in the night

11. Paleblood Moon (Bloodborne) 04:30
	

A paleblood moon
A place consumed
A paleblood moonrise

Arise from the deepest dream
A haven in a haze
The howls and the sickly screams they fade...

Pale blood will guide your way
Embrace the changes and be consumed
Bleak bells that chime dismay
Echo the cries of the paleblood moon

Cruel and brutal the blades of the beast
Carve and clatter and cleave
Bathed in blood of the damned, deseased
Through the withered we weave

Teeth
Tear and rend
Meat
Maim and end

Pale blood will guide your way
Embrace the changes and be consumed
Bleak bells that chime dismay
Echo the cries of the paleblood moon


A paleblood moon
A place consumed
A paleblood moonrise

The cogs creak a melody
Sing a lullaby for the doomed
The ones who would never be
Will find a vessel in the paleblood moon

12. Friends To Foes (Halo V) 04:54
		
	
When the final hymns have been composed
The chants become a distant drone
Back into the cold machine
Hammer my hardened heart
Now it pulses all alone

Step back
Drop the trail
Hard hack
We prevail...

When friends turn to foes
When time starts to slow
Remember the faces lost and gone
When friends turn to foes
The moons cast no glow
Remember the reason you go on

In these glowing globes, a newfound hope
I try to watch the sunlit sides
Out across the universe
A great blue wave will build
In the breaking of the tide

We prevail

When friends turn to foes
When time starts to slow
Remember the faces lost and gone
When friends turn to foes
The moons cast no glow
Remember the reason you go on

Step back
Drop the trail
Hard hack

I was there by your side...
I was there by your side...

We prevail

When friends turn to foes
When time starts to slow
Remember the faces lost and gone
When friends turn to foes
The moons cast no glow
Remember the reason you go on

I was there by your side...
I was there by your side...

Hammer into the heart
Everything falls apart
Hammer into the heart
Beating on a broken promise

14. I Am Pudge (DOTA 2) 02:54
	
	
I am Pudge
Built of sludge
Through the jungles and the loaded lanes I trudge
Out' my way
Hook the prey
When you're blunderin', bumblin' I come out to play

And they hate me cause I'm greedy
But a hero's got to eat
They whinge and whine and whimper
Cause I snatch all of the meat
And they yell that I am cheap
And that I undermine the rest
And they're right you know my prices are the best
Get rekt

One, two
Now I got my hooks in you
To
Send you to the cooks to stew
Chew
Now I got my hooks in you

I am Pudge
Built of sludge
You can push and pull but I will never budge
Meat so fresh
Lovely flesh
On these legs of lard I thud and thump and thresh

And they hate me cause I'm greedy
But a hero's got to eat
They whinge and whine and whimper
Cause I snatch all of the meat
And they yell that I am cheap
And that I undermine the rest
And they're right you know my prices are the best
Get rekt

One, two
Now I got my hooks in you
To
Send you to the cooks to stew
Chew
Now I got my hooks in you

15. Hard Cash 2015 (GTA V) 04:11
	
		
Smoke over the city's soul
Pollutes our sons and daughters
You can fall asleep on sheets of gold
And still wake up a pauper

We all get old
We all slow down
As the walls they close
We fall we're drowning

I need some breathing space
I won't grow old with grace
I need some breathing space
I can't keep living straight...

We ain't gonna linger and lie low
When there's hard cash coming back
No way I'll just sit here when I know
That there's hard cash coming back

Hard hard cash
Don't want no easy money

Money couldn't buy me happiness
Just a prettier misery
There's a price to pay
For a life of luxury

The air is thin
The glare the smoke and
The wear within
It tears it's choking

I need some breathing space
I won't grow old with grace
I need some breathing space
I can't keep living straight...

We ain't gonna linger and lie low
When there's hard cash coming back
No way I'll just sit here when I know
That there's hard cash coming back

Hard hard cash
Don't want no easy money

And now that we have all arrived
My friends get in your cars and drive
